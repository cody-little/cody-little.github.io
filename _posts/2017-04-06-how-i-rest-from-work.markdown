# Experience Across Different Fields

Throughout both my undergraduate and graduate education I have worked in the public policy field performing data analysis and research on a variety of topics. I have worked at two seperate organizations the Arthur J. Glatfelter Institute of Public Policy in York, Pennsylvania and the Penn Child Research Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My responsibilies and experience gained at both organizations varied but my cumulative experience performing analysis and public policy work totals more than two years. 

## Penn Child Research Center

I started working at the Penn Child Research Center as a survey research intern in spring of 2020 directly reporting to a highly knowledgeable project coordinator. My time at the research center has been nothing short of spectacular for skill and professional development. My responsibilites have grown over time but during my entire tenure at the position I have worked on a significant research project addressing ethno-racial disparities in Philadelphia's child welfare system regarding out-of-home placements.
