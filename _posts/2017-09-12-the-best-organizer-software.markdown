Over the course of my professional and academic experience I have developed strong programming skills for statistics, machine learning, and data visualizations. I have written code that ranges from building interactive dashboards with R shiny to optimizing the hyperperameters on a gradient boosted tree algorithim. Check out some details below or my Github to see some sample work. Along with using these skills I have experience using HTML, CSS, and SQL as well, working with data forces you to be highly adaptive to learning new skills so I am always yearning to learn more. Check out some sample project descriptions and links to my github to view the code below.
