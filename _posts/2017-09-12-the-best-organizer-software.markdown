## Highlighted Research

### Toward No-Context Flagging of Disinformation
#### Field: Machine Learning, Computational Linguistics, Political Science

Research paper utilizing a multi-step machine learning classifier pipeline to predict disinformation short texts using a 300 dimensional word vector space. Completed initial research as a final paper for Practical Machine Learning Methods course at UPenn. Spent summer of 2020 drafting it into a rigorous academic paper and submitted to a workshop at the 2020 Conference on Computational Linguistics for peer review. While not accepted to the highly competitive conference, the paper recieved strong reviews and was complimented generously. The machine learning pipeline correctly flagged 228/250 disinformation texts amidst over 1,000 non-disinformation using only text features. Will be submitted again once a suitable venue is found.


### Assumption Corrected Mediation Effects Regression for Gender Wage Differences in Male Dominated Industries
#### Field: Public Policy, Statistics, Economics

Full scale research paper completed as final assignment of Applied Linear Modelling course during graduate degree at UPenn. The paper is seen as the culminating research paper for the degree. Using data from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) I completed a multivariate regression modelling analysis while correcting for the assumptions of the linear model. I analyzed weekly wage difference between men and women across industries that are notably filled with male workers such as finance and technology. While controlling for education, age, and industry I showed a statistically signifcant mediation effect of being male and working in those industries. 

### United Way of York County 2017 Hispanic and Latinx Community Assessment
#### Field: Public Policy, Economics, Demograpy

While working as an intern at the Arthur J. Glatfelter Intitute for Public Policy I co-authored a report for the United Way of York County. Using survey data we analyzed the sentiments and assessed the current status of the Hispanic and Latinx community within the county. The report shed light on inequities and recieved strong feedback from political and community members. I was interviewed on two occasions by the media for my role in the research. Once for Our York Media for an online article and once live on air for WITF Public Radio.

### Financial and Racial Segregation's Effect on Education In York City
#### Field: Public Policy, Political Science, Economics

This research was conducted as my Senior Thesis at York College of Pennsylvania for my BA in Political Science. Using logistic regression I explored the effects that financial and racial segreation have on York City. Through an indepth statistical analysis I used American Community Survey data to show that census tracts with a majority of racial and ethnic minorities were more likely to fall under the average high school graduation rates across the city.
