# Experience Across Different Fields

Throughout both my undergraduate and graduate education I have worked in the public policy field performing data analysis and research on a variety of topics. I have worked at two seperate organizations; the Arthur J. Glatfelter Institute of Public Policy in York, Pennsylvania and the Penn Child Research Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My responsibilies at both organizations varied but my cumulative experience performing analysis and public policy work totals more than two years. 

## Penn Child Research Center

I started working at the Penn Child Research Center as a survey research intern in spring of 2020 directly reporting to a highly knowledgeable project coordinator. My time at the research center has been nothing short of spectacular for skill and professional development. My responsibilites have grown over time but during my entire tenure at the position I have worked on a significant research project addressing ethno-racial disparities in Philadelphia's child welfare system regarding out-of-home placements.

## Arthur J. Glatfelter Institute for Public Policy

My time at here began in the fall of 2017, I worked and reported directly to the director of the institute and it was the formative experience that led me into analytical and publc policy research. I worked across the entire range of the policy spectrum from data analysis, to research design, meeting with community stakeholders and everthing in between. My experience here was phenomenal thanks to a great mentor. My biggest accomplishment here is a quantitative research report which gained local recognition for the impact it had on city and county level policy decisions, see more about the report below.

### 2017 United Way of York County Hispanic and Latinx Community Assessment

I co-authored this report with the director of the intsitute for the United Way of York County. We deployed a survey to a statistically representative sample population of Hispanic and Latinx community of York County. The report sought to assess how well the communnity was accessing social services. My role included building the survey, entering the paper results, and analyzing the results using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The report garnered a significant amount of attention by city and state level media and governmental officials. I was interviewed by a media source called Our York Media and by WITF radio on thier smart talk segment live on air.
